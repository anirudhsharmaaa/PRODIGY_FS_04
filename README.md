# REAL TIME CHAT APPLICATION
This project is a real-time chat application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and Socket.IO technology. The application allows users to create accounts, join chat rooms, or initiate private conversations, and exchange text messages in real-time.

Additional features such as notifications, user presence indicators, and multimedia file-sharing capabilities enhance the chat experience.
